The Charter Review Board is appointed every five years, per a mandate by the Hillsborough County Charter, to conduct a comprehensive study of any or all phases of county government. The Board of County Commissioners selects its 14 members. Each commissioner appoints two members from their district, none of whom can be an elected official.

The board will hold two public hearings for any proposed amendments to the charter. Proposed amendments to the charter must be approved by two-thirds of the Charter Review Board members, and then voted upon in a public referendum.

The Charter Review Board is currently in session and holding monthly meetings. View the informational video to learn more.
