When Emanuel Johnson arrived in Progress Village in 1960 there were no lights. No bus service. No phones.

"We sat on 78th St. and looked east over cow pastures," Johnson recalled.

But Johnson and his wife, Ruby, saw potential. And so did others like them. Jobs leads were slim in the early 1960s. Racial tension and riots raged across the country.

For $250 down and $58 a month Progress Village became a refuge. Johnson purchased a white house with green trim on a corner lot.

One by one homes began springing up in the mostly African-American neighborhood just south of downtown Tampa. And with those homes came children, churches, schools and businesses.

Johnson, a father of eight, worked for DeVoe Paint Company. He also ran one of the neighborhood's first businesses - a concession store inside a tool shed. There, kids could buy Red Hot candy and Royal Crown hair grease. For 5-cents they could play a song on a piccolo music box out back, he said. The tool shed doubled as a community meeting place.

One day while at the store, Hillsborough County Educator Vivian Gaither came by to spoke to the men congregated there. He encouraged them to continue growing Progress Village.

"You are the pioneers," Johnson recalls Gaither saying to the group. "We were the pioneers."
