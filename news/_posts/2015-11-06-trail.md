Lace up those sneakers, pump up those tires, and head over to the new Lutz Lake Fern Road Trailhead and new section of Upper Tampa Bay Trail. The new trailhead features a parking area, restrooms, a covered picnic area, and an automated pay station - the first at a County trailhead.

From the trailhead, the multi-use trail extends 1.5 miles east and then north to connect with the Suncoast Trail. This portion includes three sections of concrete boardwalk that pass over wetlands, and a signalized crossing at Lutz Lake Fern Road. The trail extends nearly three miles to the southwest along the edge of Brooker Creek Preserve. It is the first paved trail in Hillsborough County to traverse a preserve and was designed to minimize impact to the preserve.

We strapped a GoPro onto a bike for a first hand glimpse of the new portion of the trail. Check out the video below:
