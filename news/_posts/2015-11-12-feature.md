When Emanuel Johnson arrived in Progress Village in 1960 there were no lights. No bus service. No phones.

"We sat on 78th St. and looked east over cow pastures," Johnson recalled.

But Johnson and his wife, Ruby, saw potential. And so did others like them. Jobs leads were slim in the early 1960s. Racial tension and riots raged across the country.

For $250 down and $58 a month Progress Village became a refuge. Johnson purchased a white house with green trim on a corner lot.

One by one homes began springing up in the mostly African-American neighborhood just south of downtown Tampa. And with those homes came children, churches, schools and businesses.

Johnson, a father of eight, worked for DeVoe Paint Company. He also ran one of the neighborhood's first businesses - a concession store inside a tool shed. There, kids could buy Red Hot candy and Royal Crown hair grease. For 5-cents they could play a song on a piccolo music box out back, he said. The tool shed doubled as a community meeting place.

One day while at the store, Hillsborough County Educator Vivian Gaither came by to spoke to the men congregated there. He encouraged them to continue growing Progress Village.

"You are the pioneers," Johnson recalls Gaither saying to the group. "We were the pioneers."

Johnson took his role in the community seriously. He'd ride up and down the streets using a bull horn to remind people of community meetings.

Through the years he became known as the "Mayor of Progress Village."

Now at 94 years old, Johnson is the last of the men known as the Progress Village pioneers who is still alive. Hillsborough County will honor him with the unveiling of the Emanuel P. Johnson Progress Village Community Center and Gymnasium on December 19.

The new $2.3 million facility includes a 7,000-square-foot gymnasium and 8,000 square feet of recreational space equipped with a multi-purpose room, kitchen, arts and crafts room, exercise and weight training rooms, computer lab, and game room.

It's a far cry from the tool shed concession stand that used to be the gathering place for Progress Village's first residents.

"I wish they were here to see where we are today,"  Johnson said.
