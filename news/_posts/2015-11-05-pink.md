Hillsborough County is part of the national effort to raise awareness about breast cancer and recognize survivors and their families, during the month of October. Thursday, Oct. 22 is designated as Breast Cancer Awareness Day in Hillsborough County. As part of the County's Think Pink - Wear Pink event, breast cancer survivors and those affected participated in a sidewalk art display by adding their names to an inspirational mural. Commissioner Sandra L. Murman delivered a proclamation to the Florida Division of American Cancer Society.
